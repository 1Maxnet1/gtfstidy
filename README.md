# gtfstidy

Tidy [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) feeds.

Fixes small inconsistencies, minimizes the overall feed size, prepares the feed for secure, standard-compliant further usage.

Output feeds are **semantically equivalent** to the input feed. In this context, semantical equivalency means that the output feed provides exactly the same trips with exactly the same attributes (routes, stop-times, shapes, agency, fares etc.). In other words, the output feed is equivalent the to input feed from a passenger's perspective.

## 0. Features

* **Clean CSV output.** Only quote string values where needed, use dynamic float precision, remove whitespace. Only output files that are necessary.
* **Default-value error handling.** If non-required fields in the input-feed have errors, fall back to the default value according to the GTFS standard
* **Drop-entities error handling.** If non-fixable errors occur, drop the affected entity (trip, route, stop, etc.).
* **Orphan deletion**. Delete stops, routes, stop times and shapes that aren't referenced anywhere
* **ID minimization**. Replace IDs by dense integer or character IDs
* **Shape minimization**. Minimize shape geometries using the [Douglas-Peucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm) algorithm
* **Service minimization**. Minimize services in `calender.txt` and `calender_dates.txt` by searching optimal progression and/or exception covers.
* **Trip/Stop-Time minimization**. Minimize trips and stop-times by analyzing `stop_times.txt` and `frequencies.txt` and searching for optimal frequency covers.
* **Shape remeasurement**. If shape measures (`shape_dist_traveled`) have gaps, try to fill them by interpolating surrounding measurements
* **Duplicate removal**. Safely remove routes, shapes and services that are semantically equivalent to others and combine them into one.

## 5. Available processors

There are two classes of processors. Processors with a lowercase flag modify existing entries. Processors with an uppercase flag **delete** existing entries, either because they are duplicates or because they can be combined with other entries.

### ID minimizer

---

IDs are packed into dense integer arrays, either as base 10 or base 36 integer. You should not use this processor if you are referencing entities from outside the static feed (for example, if the IDs are references from a GTFS-realtime feed).

#### Flags

* `-i`: pack IDs into dense base 10 integers
* `-d`: pack IDs into dense base 36 integers

#### Modifies
Every file.


#### Example
##### Before

`routes.txt`

```
route_id,agency_id,route_short_name,route_long_name,route_desc,route_type,route_url,route_color,route_text_color
AB,DTA,10,Airport - Bullfrog,,3,,,
BFC,DTA,20,Bullfrog - Furnace Creek Resort,,3,,,
STBA,DTA,30,Stagecoach - Airport Shuttle,,3,,,
CITY,DTA,40,City,,3,,,
AAMV,DTA,50,Airport - Amargosa Valley,,3,,,
AAMV2,DTA,50,Airport - Amargosa Valley,,3,,,
```

##### After
`routes.txt`
```
route_id,agency_id,route_short_name,route_long_name,route_type,route_color,route_text_color

1,1,10,Airport - Bullfrog,3,FFFFFF,000000
```

### Orphan remover

---

Feed is checked for entries that are not referenced anywhere. These entries are removed from the output.

#### Flags
* `-O`: remove entities that are not referenced anywhere

#### Modifies

`trips.txt`, `stops.txt`, `routes.txt`, `calendar_dates.txt`, `calendar.txt`

#### Example

### Shape minimizer

---

Minimizes shape geometries using Douglas-Peucker. This processor **implicitely calls the shape remeasurer!** The shape coordinates are projected to web mercator ([EPSG:3857](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/7483/)) prior to minimization. The Îµ value for Douglas-Peucker is set to 1.0

#### Flags

* `-s`: minimize shapes (using Douglas-Peucker)

#### Modifies

`shapes.txt`

#### Example

##### Before

`shapes.txt`

```
shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence,shape_dist_traveled

```
### Service minimizer

---

Minimizes service ranges in `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt` by searching for optimal coverages of range entries in `calendar.txt` and exception entries in `calendar_dates.txt`.

#### Flags
* `-c`: minimize services by searching for the optimal exception/range coverage

#### Modifies
`calendar.txt`, `calendar_dates.txt`

#### Example

##### Before

`calendar.txt`

```
(empty)
```

`calendar_dates.txt`

```

```
`calendar_dates.txt`
```
(empty)
```
### Trip/Stop-times minimizer

Minimizes stop times in `stop_times.txt` and trips in `trips.txt` by searching for progression (frequency) covers on the stop times. If multiple trips with equivalent attributes (route, shapes etc) and the same relative stop times are found, they are checked for frequency patterns. If a pattern could be found, the trips are combined into a single frequency-based trip (via `frequency.txt`).

The algorithm is based on a CAP (Cover by Arithmetic Progression) algorithm proposed by [Hannah Bast and Sabine Storandt](http://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/SIGSPATIAL_frequency_BS_2014.pdf).

#### Flags
* `-T`: search for frequency patterns in explicit trips and combine them

#### Modifies
`trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `frequencies.txt`

#### Example

##### Before
`stop_times.txt`
```

Removes duplicate routes (routes that have the same attributes and the same fare rules), updates references in `trips.txt` and deletes redundant rules in `fare_rules.txt` as well.

#### Flags

### Service duplicate remover

---

Removes duplicate services (services that covers the same set of dates) and updates references.
#### Flags
* `-C`: remove duplicate services in calendar.txt and calendar_dates.txt

#### Modifies
`calendar_dates.txt`, `calendar.txt`, `trips.txt`

```
### Shape duplicate remover

---

Removes duplicate shapes and updates references in `trips.txt`. Shape equality testing is done with a simple heuristic which resembles the [FrÃ©chet-Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance) but is faster. The check never underestimates the distance between two shapes, but overestimates it for shapes with total distances that are `>>` the max distance. **This processor implicitely calls the shape remeasurer**.

#### Flags
* `-S`: remove shape duplicates

#### Modifies
`shapes.txt`, `trips.txt`

#### Example

##### Before

`shapes.txt`
```

shape_id,shape_pt_lat,shape_pt_lon,shape_pt_sequence,shape_dist_traveled
A_shp,0,0,1,0
A_shp,0.6,0.5,2,6.831
A_shp,1,1,3,15.8765
A_shp,2,1,4,26.315065
A_shp,3,1,5,36.76
A_shp,3.5,1,6,42.910156

### Set erroneous values to standard defaults

---

If optional field values of feed entries have errors, this processors sets them to the default values specified in the GTFS standard.

#### Flags:

* `-D`: drop erroneous entries from feed

#### Modifies:

Every file, if errors are present.

## 6. Processing order

The order in which feed processors are called is *always the same*, regardless of the flag ordering. The processors are run in this order:

1. Default erroneous values (`-e`)
2. Drop erroneous entries (`-D`)
3. Remove orphans (`-O`)
4. Remeasure shapes (`-m`)
5. Minimize shapes (`-s`)
6. Remove shape duplicates (`-S`)
7. Remove route duplicates (`-R`)
8. Remove service duplicates (`-C`)
9. Minimize services (`-c`)
10. Minimize stop-times/trips (`-T`)
11. Minimize IDs (`-i` or `-d`)
